    				  <h1>FastPass Plus</h1>
    				  <p>FastPass+ allows guests to reserve and plan a visit to a Disney Park in advance for select FastPass+ attractions, Character Greetings, entertainment, and viewing areas for parades and fireworks. The new system allows guests to make reservations up to 60 days in advance, and change at any time. FastPass+ is a reservation and scheduling system, unlike the old paper FASTPASS system, which was virtual queuing concept. Additionally, guests are encouraged to reserve FastPass+ sections with their group and are allowed to change the groups FastPass+ reservation as an individual guest would. Currently guests staying at an onsite Disney resort can make reservations up to 60 days in advance while all other guests can schedule reservations up to 30 days in advance, assuming tickets are linked to their account. Annual Passholders can hold Fastpass+ reservations for up to 7 different days in the 30 day window. If a Passholder is staying at a Disney resort onsite, they have 60 days to make reservations for the entire length of the stay. Guests can make three reservations in advance for each day, and all three must be at the same theme park. Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios separate the attractions available for reservation into two tiers. Guests are restricted in the combination of attractions they are able to reserve in these parks to ensure better reservation availability for others at the parks most popular attractions. Guests may make a further reservation via an in-park kiosk after they have used their initial three selections subject to further reservation slots being available. They may continue to do so after each reservation has been used until all reservation slots have been allocated for the day.</p>
    				  <p>Walt Disney World in Florida is currently the only resort to have implemented FastPass+ to replace the paper ticket based system as part of its wider introduction of the MyMagic+ vacation planning, ticketing and reservation system. These changes may be implemented to other Disney resorts worldwide in the future, though no timescale for implementation has been released.</p>
