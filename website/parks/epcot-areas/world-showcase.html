   				    <h1>World Showcase</h1>
   				    <p><strong>World Showcase</strong> is a large area reminiscent of a permanent world's fair containing eleven pavilions, each themed and dedicated to represent a specific country. The eleven pavilions surround the World Showcase Lagoon, a large man-made lake located in the center of World Showcase with a perimeter of 1.2 miles.</p>
   				    <p>Of the eleven pavilions, Norway and Morocco were not present at the park's opening, and were added later. Each pavilion contains themed architecture, landscapes, streetscapes, attractions, shops, and restaurants representing the respective country's culture and cuisine. In an effort to maintain the authenticity of the represented countries, the pavilions are primarily staffed by citizens of the respective countries as part of the Cultural Representative Program through J-1 visa agreements. Some pavilions also contain themed rides, shows, and live entertainment representative of the respective country. The only pavilion that is directly sponsored by the government of its respective country is Morocco, the remaining pavilions are primarily sponsored by private companies with affiliations to the represented countries.</p>
   				    <p>Pavilions for Puerto Rico, Russia, Switzerland, Spain, Venezuela, United Arab Emirates, and Israel have occasionally been rumored as potential future pavilions but have never made it past the planning phases to date. The Israeli, Spanish, and an Equatorial Africa were even announced as coming soon in 1982, but never took off. Instead, a small African themed refreshment shop known as The Outpost currently resides where Equatorial Africa was to be. Israel, five African countries (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa), as well as eight other countries (Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, and Sweden) took part in the Millennium Village during the Millennium Celebration.</p>
   				    <p>Contrary to popular belief, there are currently 9 undeveloped spots for countries around the World Showcase, including the space occupied by The Outpost. These spots are in between most of the countries, with the exceptions of Japan to The American Adventure, The American Adventure to Italy (both due to The American Adventure's reversed forced perspective, which would be ruined by pavilions immediately next to it), and Norway to China (separated only by a service road, they are the only two pavilions right next to each other).</p>
