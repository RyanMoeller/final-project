   				    <h1>Animation Courtyard</h1>
   				    <p>Animation Courtyard is home to several attractions based on Disney animated films. The Magic of Disney Animation is an attraction that examines the development process of an animated character. It also includes interactive games and exhibits, along with meet-and-greet areas for Disney and Pixar characters. This section of the park originally was the starting point for the tours of the park's active production studios. Its entrance is marked by a square &quot;studio arch,&quot; much like a real Hollywood studio lot entrance might be marked.</p>
   				    <p>When the park first opened in 1989, the <em>Feature Animation</em> pavilion of &quot;The Magic of Disney Animation,&quot; designed originally by award winning experience designer Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, included four connected experiences which explored the legacy of Disney animation. The tour commenced with a short film, entitled &quot;Back to Neverland,&quot; in which veteran newscaster, Walter Cronkite and actor Robin Williams described the animation process by turning Williams into an animated character in the form of one of the &quot;Lost Boys&quot; of Peter Pan. Following that introductory film, guest would witness the process of animation, first-hand, from elevated, glass-enclosed walkways within one of Disney's actual animation studios, located on the park grounds. The third segment of the animation tour was a short film in which Disney Animators described the joy of the art of animation. A finale film, entitled &quot;Classic Disney&quot; presented a montage of key moments from classic animated Disney films.</p>
   				    <p>Mickey Avenue, a sub-section of Animation Courtyard, is home to a walk-through exhibit, Walt Disney: One Man's Dream, which explores the life and legacy of Walt Disney through photos, models, rare artifacts, and a short biographical film narrated by Julie Andrews. The Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow, is an immersive special effects attraction centered on the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow from the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> series. The Courtyard section also hosts two live shows.<em>Disney Junior Live on Stage!</em> entertains guests with puppet characters from the &quot;Disney Junior&quot; block of programming on The Disney Channel, including Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Doc McStuffins, and Sofia the First. Across the plaza, <em>Voyage of the Little Mermaid</em> uses glow-in-the-dark puppets, lasers, music, projectors, human actors and water effects to recreate favorite scenes and songs from the animated <em>Little Mermaid</em> film.</p>
   				    <p>The Animation Courtyard is also home to Pixar Place. Pixar Place is dedicated to films and characters created by Pixar Animation Studios. The area, which resembles the animation studio's Emeryville, California campus, includes many of the original sound stages used when the park operated an active production studio. Its sole attraction is Toy Story Midway Mania!, an interactive 4D attraction inspired by classic carnival midway games, each hosted by characters from the <em>Toy Story</em> film series. Pixar Place was also the home of Luxo Jr., a six-foot-tall audio-animatronic version of Pixar's desk-lamp mascot. The moving character performs periodic shows throughout the day and evening across from Toy Story Midway Mania.</p>
   				    <p>&nbsp;</p>
   				    <h3>Tips:</h3>
   				    <p><em>Toy Story Mania</em> is one of the most popular attractions on Disney property so you can imagine the wait times will be rather outrageous. FastPass for this is a must, but take into consideration that the queue for this ride is filled with fun references and is built to resemble a child's toybox so it can be fun to wait this one out. A giant talking Mr. Potato Head also makes the queue pretty worthwile as well. </p>
