   				    <h1>Main Street, U.S.A.</h1>
   				    <p>Symbolically, Main Street, U.S.A. represents the park's &quot;opening credits,&quot; where guests pass under the train station (the opening curtain,) then view the names of key personnel along the windows of the buildings' upper floors. Many windows bear the name of a fictional business, such as &quot;Seven Summits Expeditions, Frank G. Wells President&quot;, with each representing a tribute to significant people connected to the Disney company and the development of the Walt Disney World Resort. It features stylistic influences from around the country. Taking its inspiration from New England to Missouri, this design is most noticeable in the four corners in the middle of Main Street, where each of the four corner buildings represents a different architectural style. There is no opera house as there is at Disneyland; instead, there is the Town Square Theater. Also, this is where Christopher George Weaver, the &quot;mayor&quot; of Main Street U.S.A., and one of the park's most important figures, resides.</p>
   				    <p>Main Street is lined with shops selling merchandise and food. The decor is early-20th century small-town America, inspired by Walt Disney's childhood and the film <em>Lady and the Tramp</em>. City Hall contains the Guest Relations lobby, where cast members provide information and assistance. A working barber shop gives haircuts for a fee. The Emporium carries a wide variety of Disney souvenirs such as plush toys, collectible pins and Mickey-ear hats. Tony&rsquo;s Town Square Restaurant and The Plaza Restaurant are table-service locations. At the end of Main Street is Casey's Corner, where guests enjoy traditional American ballpark fare including hot dogs and fries while watching old cartoons on the bleachers. The Main Street Confectionary sells sweets priced by their weight, such as candied apples, crisped rice treats, chocolates, cookies and fudge. Most windows bear the name of people who were influential at Disney parks. An example of a classic Main Street, U.S.A. attraction is the 3 ft narrow gauge Walt Disney World Railroad, which transports guest throughout the park, making stops at Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, and Frontierland. The railroad's previous stop at Mickey's Toontown Fair was replaced by the Fantasyland stop in 2012. Main Street, U.S.A. also has the Main Street Vehicles attraction, which includes a 3 ft narrow gauge tramway with horse-drawn streetcars, and several old-fashioned motor vehicles.</p>
   				    <p>In the distance beyond the end of Main Street stands Cinderella Castle. Though only 189 feet tall, it benefits from a technique known as forced perspective. The second stories of all the buildings along Main Street are shorter than the first stories, and the third stories are even shorter than the second, and the top windows of the castle are much smaller than they appear. The resulting visual effect is that the buildings appear to be larger and taller than they really are.</p>
   				    <p>The park contains two additional tributes: the <em>Partners</em> statue of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse in front of Cinderella Castle and the <em>Sharing the Magic</em> statue of Roy O. Disney sitting with Minnie Mouse in the Town Square section of Main Street, U.S.A. Both were sculpted by veteran Imagineer Blaine Gibson. In 2012, Disney replaced the shop in the Firehouse with a sign up for the Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom game.</p>
