   				    <h1>Tomorrowland</h1>
   				    <p>Tomorrowland is one of the many theme lands at the five Disney theme parks around the world owned or licensed by The Walt Disney Company. Each version of the land is different and features numerous attractions that depict views of the future. Disneyland Park (Paris) includes a similar area called Discoveryland, which shares some elements with other Tomorrowlands but emphasizes Jules Verne-inspired visions of a future that never came to fruition.</p>
   				    <p>Walt Disney was known for his futurist views and, through his television programs, showed the American public how the world was moving into the future. Tomorrowland was the realized culmination of his views. In his own words: &quot;Tomorrow can be a wonderful age. Our scientists today are opening the doors of the Space Age to achievements that will benefit our children and generations to come. The Tomorrowland attractions have been designed to give you an opportunity to participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future.&quot;</p>
   				    <p>It is this movement into the future that has, on occasion, left Tomorrowland mired in the past. Disneyland's Tomorrowland is now in its third generation, and the Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland is in its second. The Walt Disney Company has mentioned that it wanted to keep Tomorrowland from becoming &quot;Yesterdayland&quot;. As a self-referential joke along this line, the 2007 Disney animated film <em>Meet the Robinsons</em> (which is set mainly in the year 2037) features an amusement park called <em>Todayland</em>, which has rides that look remarkably like Space Mountain and Disneyland's original Rocket Jets. </p>
   				    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
   				    <h2>Tips:</h2>
   				    <p><em>Space Mountain </em>is by far Tomorrowland's featured attraction. It was refurbished in 2009 with a new track and a new queue that features a few interactive games for guests waiting on-line. This can lead to longer wait times since guests tend to stop to play, on top of the already long wait times due to the popularity of the ride. I've found that for this attraction, FastPass or FastPlus Plus is a must, so once you know what days you'll be at Magic Kingdom, use the MyMagic Plus application to reserve a FastPass time. </p>
